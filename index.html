          <h4> Project: IAT339 Company Website Design</h4>
          <p>This is a project required to design a website for a fictional company we established, "H.T Cake".
            As a food service business, the design of its website tests some really important considerations of
            daily element implications, which means, except the aesthetics for the layout, the functions are the
            bigger parts where the experiences of the users are mainly relying on. In this case, a good design should
            not only satisfy users' comforts: is the color harmonic, is the size of image suitable, etc., but also
            guarantee the convenience of achieving the main goals, which on this website, to browse the products
            and learn about the information, and very potentially the further steps in making the orders.
          </p>

          <p>From my perspective, I am satisfied what we (this project is done with a partner) have created out.
            The tests for usability were qualified as the most common functions needed in the website of a food
            company are all achieved, such as a clear listed product menu, a informative product detail page, a clear
            shopping cart and payment page that is easy to follow. And for the design aesthetics, the layout of
            the elements across each page are consistent, the color selections are harmonic and suitable for the
            theme of the company, the responsive designs also look great, although I feel some of the components
            or images are too sharp to be there which requires some finer polish. In general, I feel this project
            successfully improved my knowledge on how to design for the demands and needs of the users rather than
            making arbitrary decisions.

          <h4> Project: IAT235 Information Website Design</h4>
          <p>This is a project required to design a information website for a fictional moutain safety and rescue team.
            As a non-profit association, this website mainly accounts for popularizing the safety guidelines and rescue
            knowledge about two topics: Avalanche and Hypothemia, as well as intorudcing the team itself. In this case,
            the design focus is to accurately express the correct guideline information to the users while the layout of
            the website maintains the aesthetics level, and the former should be the most important part.
          </p>

          <p>From my perspective, I am satisfied what we (this project is done with two partners) have created out.
            IAT 235 was the first time that I attaced website designing. At that stage I was researching and doing some
            pratical designs in order to try my best to make the website look professional. Basically the page layouts
            are the same for the pages which account for same purposes. The color scheme for the website were also selected
            to fit the topics well. The usability tests were not bad as most of the functions worked well. The information
            sections combined both text and visualize elements to create comfort reading experiences for users. What I feel
            not perfect is the sizes of the elements. As this is the first approach, some of the size decisions seemed to be
            inappropriate as they may look too big on screens. The compositions of some of the elements can also have some
            improvements. But overall I think in this project we successfully expressed the information as planned and the
            whole website looks good in terms of color harmonic and theme relevance. I have gained some knowledge about informative
            designs and have learned many basic rules in website development.
